# Cursor Rules for Shopify Store MCP

## Git Commits

**NEVER add Co-Authored-By lines to commits.** Do not attribute commits to Claude, Cursor, or any AI assistant.

## Code Patterns

- Use `.js` extension in all TypeScript imports
- Use `console.error` instead of `console.log` (STDIO transport)
- Use `enqueue()` for all Shopify API calls (rate limiting)
- Use `normalizeGid()` for Shopify IDs
- Use error utilities from `src/errors.ts`

## Project Architecture

- `run_graphql_query` is the universal tool for any Shopify GraphQL
- Smart tools handle multi-step workflows (polling, staged uploads)
- Don't create per-resource CRUD tools

See CLAUDE.md for full documentation.
